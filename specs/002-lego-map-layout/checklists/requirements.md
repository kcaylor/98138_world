# Specification Quality Checklist: LEGO Map Layout Generation

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-01-06
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: ✅ PASSED - All checklist items complete

**Notes**:
- Specification is complete and ready for planning phase
- All 3 user stories are independently testable with clear priorities
- 17 functional requirements defined with testable outcomes
- 10 success criteria with measurable metrics
- 7 assumptions documented to guide implementation
- 6 key entities identified for data modeling
- Edge cases identified for defensive implementation
- No clarifications needed - all requirements have reasonable defaults documented in Assumptions section
